# Next.js Static Blog

This is a repository for a boilerplate project that allows you to create a blog with automatically generated static pages based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Markdown. It uses TypeScript as its primary language.

Or at least that is the goal. This project is just getting started.
