# Next.js Static Blog

This is a repository for a boilerplate project that allows you to create a blog with automatically generated static pages based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Markdown. It uses TypeScript as its primary language.

Since the project is just a boilerplate, it only provides the bare-essentials for getting started. A basic Bootstrap-based design is included, but it does not force you to use any specific framework.

## Features

These are the primary features that the project has:

- Modern frontend development with React
- Static page generation using Next.js with the option for server-side rendered pages
- Markdown is used for posts, but can optionally be used for page content as well
- Post categories
- Post author pages
- Archive pages for month and years
- Type safety through TypeScript
